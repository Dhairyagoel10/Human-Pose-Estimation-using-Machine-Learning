# Human-Pose-Estimation-using-Machine-Learning
In my project, "Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning," I develop a system that uses deep learning techniques to detect and analyze human body poses from images or videos. This solution has applications in areas such as fitness, gaming, surveillance, and motion analysis.

Machine Learning Libraries:

TensorFlow: For building and training machine learning models, TensorFlow is used to implement deep learning models for pose detection.
Keras: A high-level API for TensorFlow, Keras simplifies model building and training, enabling faster experimentation and prototyping.
Pose Estimation Framework:

OpenPose: OpenPose is one of the most widely used frameworks for real-time multi-person detection. It provides a robust solution for estimating human poses.
MediaPipe: A framework developed by Google for building pipelines for vision tasks, including pose detection. It allows efficient and accurate real-time pose estimation.
Python: The core programming language used to develop the project, with libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations and OpenCV for handling video and image processing tasks.

OpenCV: This is an open-source computer vision library that enables image and video processing. OpenCV is used to capture real-time video frames and pre-process them for pose detection.

HOW IT WORKS:


MediaPipe uses TensorFlow Lite in the backend to perform pose estimation efficiently. The process begins with a person detection module, which identifies the region of interest (ROI) in the frame containing the human body. This cropped ROI is then passed to the pose estimator, which predicts the keypoints or landmarks within the human body. MediaPipe Pose Estimation detects a total of 33 keypoints on the body, including key regions such as the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.

Key Features of MediaPipe Pose Estimation: 1.3D Pose Estimation: MediaPipe Pose estimates the x, y, and z coordinates for each landmark, where:

x and y represent the 2D position of a landmark.

z gives the depth of a landmark relative to others, providing an indication of how far or close a specific point is to the camera. This depth information allows for a more accurate understanding of body posture, enabling the model to detect and track poses in three-dimensional space.

Real-time Performance: MediaPipe Pose uses BlazePose, a cutting-edge research model, to achieve high-fidelity pose tracking. This solution is optimized for real-time inference, allowing it to run efficiently on a wide range of devices including mobile phones, desktops, and laptops.

Applications: The ability to detect keypoints in real-time is valuable across various use cases such as yoga, dance, fitness applications, and AR. These applications can utilize the pose landmarks for:

a) Quantifying physical exercises: Ensuring correct form and tracking progress over time. b) Sign language recognition: Mapping hand gestures to text or speech. c) Augmented Reality (AR): Overlaying digital elements on the human body based on pose data.
